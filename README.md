#Instagram Followers Check

This is a backbone project that checks the followers of an instagram user and returns how many of them are valid and invalid users.

It is intended to find the instagramers that buy bots to follow them.

Currently, we consider an invalid user when all these conditions are true:
* Has more than 400 followers
* Has Less than 6 pictures uploaded
* Is following more than 3000 instagramers
